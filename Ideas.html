		<p>Starting off, I plan to make this for <strong>Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android</strong>.</p>

		<section id="Section_Cross-Platform_Why-not-all">
			<h3 id="Cross-Platform_Why-not-all"><a href="#Section_Cross-Platform_Why-not-all">Why not iOS or Windows
				Phone?</a></h3>
			<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I'm balancing my strengths and weaknesses with what tech is out there today.</p>
			<section id="Section_Cross-Platform_Why-not-all_Technical">
				<h4 id="Cross-Platform_Why-not-all_Technical"><a
						href="#Section_Cross-Platform_Why-not-all_Technical">Super-techincal explanation:</a></h4>
				<ol>
					<li>My first choice would be <b>Swift</b>; it's a beautiful language that runs very fast and is
						cross-platform. The problems with Swift start with the IDE; Xcode is great for it, but that's
						only for macOS, and I own no computers that run that. But that's manageable, right? I could
						just buy a Mac or make a Hackintosh. Correct! So there are other issues. Swift has only very
						slight support for Linux; there's no official IDE and there's a high entry curve to creating
						a new project without one. Again, I could spend the time and effort to get that working. The
						next wall we hit is Android; Swift has no official support for it, and having dabbled in
						C++-level Android apping, I know it's much more annoying than just going with the standard JVM
						approach. And lastly, Swift doesn't support Windows or Windows Phone at all. There are
						rumblings about upcoming support, but as of right now there is none. So, Swift is sadly off the
						table.</li>
					<li>The alternative I went with is <strong>Kotlin</strong>! Kotlin is like Swift, but it runs on
						the JVM, which is supported by the aforementioned platforms, but not by iOS or Windows Phone.
						This is unfortunate, to say the least, but it's something I can live with for now. If worst
						comes to worst and I have to rewrite it for iOS, its very close similarity to Swift will ease
						that pain.</li>
					<li>The most truly cross-platform langauge I considered was <strong>C++</strong>, but... no. I
						ain't going into the realm of manual memory management and shim-based booleans and
						strings.</li>
					<li>The last thing I considered was <strong>Node.JS</strong> (and things like QT and Cordova). It's
						become very popular and has proved successful on all platforms, even with official support by
						Microsoft in the UWP. Unfortunately, I don't know Node.JS at all... I could learn it. I should
						learn it. But this is a side-project I'll work on within the 3 free hours I get each day. Maybe
						I'll end up going Node, anyway.</li>
